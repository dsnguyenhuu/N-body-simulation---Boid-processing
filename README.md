# N-body-simulation---Boid-processing
Project for Multicore Programming class. Flocks of boids were simulated and displayed using OpenGL. Each boid's position, velocity, and separation from other boid's were computed as individual threads. OpenCl and Intel TBB frameworks were used for this iteration

Ran on Visual Studio 2017 (vc141)
